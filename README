## Generating Arch Package List

For backup purposes, the file `pkglist.txt` has all the Arch packages I have installed, as [described here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages). Periodically regenerate that with:

```
pacman -Qqe > pkglist.txt
```
